  <section class="about">
    <p>
      I notice far too often that many places on Google Maps just don't have websites with menus, general updates, opening hours, and events listed. I'd like to change this for the modern age, where people can check the website before going, so they know they're going to a good place. I have seen that people (not just myself) will pick a place with an up-to-date website more often because they know what they're getting into.
